        <h2>Feminism in today's society</h2>

        <!--introduction of the article-->
        <p>I have chosen Marguerite Stern as a <b>feminist</b> of today because I think that she does
            <b>feminist</b> dactions in the continuity of Simone de Beauvoir's.
        </p>
        <p>Marguerite Stern was born on November 24, 1990. The year of her 18th birthday, which she spent in Paris, was
            very complicated because of the harassment she suffered from men in the street, and it is very angry that
            she became a French <b>feminist activist</b></p>

        <legend class="txt_leg">Marguerite Stern</legend>

        <!--Part 1 of the article-->
        <h3>What are these actions ?</h3>
        <p>Former <b>FEMEN</b>, in which she pledges to do as much <b>feminist</b> action as possible.</p>
        <p>The first in October 2012, targets ikea with their decision to erase women from their Saudi catalog, in
            accordance with national laws.</p>
        <p>But it is November 18, 2012, which is a marker of its commitment to the <b>FEMEN</b>, awith a coup-de-poing
            action against Civitas at the time of the demonstrations of the demonstration for all. They went dressed as
            nuns with fire extinguishers, on which was written "Jesus Sperm" or "Holly Sperm", where they sprayed the
            demonstrators who were singing "Nazi songs" with flags on which there were "fascist symbols."</p>
        <p>It was at this point that they were assaulted, two of them filed complaints for "voluntary violence" and on
            January 19, 2018 seven of the eight men tried for violence were sentenced to sentences of up to one year in
            prison suspended. It was this action that began to make her known.</p>

        <!--Part 2 of the article-->
        <h3>The stocks on which it is best known</h3>
        <p>Marguerite Stern is best known for creating the future mode of action of the <b>collages</b> against
            <b>feminicides</b>, of which she was the originator, an international <b>feminist</b> movement aiming to
            make visible and denounce the murders of women by their spouses or ex-spouses.
        </p>
        <p>Her <b>collages</b> are composed of black letters painted one by one on white sheets, and she sticks them in
            the streets of Marseille. Her first collaged slogan is "Since I was 13, men comment on my physical
            appearance in the street".</p>
        <p>In March 2019, she creates the first <b>collage</b> denouncing a <b>feminicide</b>, that of Julie Douib.</p>
        <p>She makes <b>collages</b> for the first time in Paris on August 25, 2019 and on August 30, 2019 she initiates
            the first collective <b>collage</b> against <b>feminicides</b>.</p>
        <p>The simplicity of the mode of action and the increase in the number of <b>feminicides</b> in France
            <b>collages</b> groups are formed in many cities, but also internationally, and the media is also interested
            in this phenomenon.
        </p>

        <legend class="txt_leg2">Marguerite Stern during a collage event</legend>


        <!--Part 3 of the article-->
        <h3>What is the main purpose of these collages ?</h3>
        <p>These <b>collages</b> display slogans that aim to raise awareness and denounce the inaction of public
            authorities to act effectively against violence against women; and also allow to pay tribute to the victims.
        </p>
        <p>By posting short sentences that describe the circumstances of the murders or that carry a general aim, put in
            places considered "symbolic" as governmental institutions, or very frequented as museums.</p>
        <p>These <b>collages</b> are symbolic for the majority of women in today's society and help many to talk about
            the domestic violence they suffer.</p>
