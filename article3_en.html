        <h2>Tomboy a gender film</h2>

        <!--introduction of the article-->
        <p>Tomboy is a film by Céline Sciamma, from 2011.</p>
        <!--link to the trailer of the movie Tomboy on Youtube-->

        <!--Part 1 of the article-->
        <h3>Presentation of the film</h3>
        <p>Laure is a 10 year old girl, who looks like a tomboy, moves to a new town, during the summer vacations, with
            her parents and her sister. Where she feels excluded.</p>
        <p>Soon after she meets Lisa who thinks she is a boy, deceived by the way she dresses, her short hair and her
            boyish looks. And who asks her "are you new?", and Laure answered "yes" after a few seconds of hesitation,
            Lisa continued by asking her "what's your name?" and Laure answered "Michael". This scene enters within the
            framework of the <b>Althusserian interpellation</b>, because the request for a first name enters the ritual
            of recognition between the children.</p>
        <p>Lisa then introduces " Mickaël " to her friends and " he " quickly becomes part of the group. Having little
            breasts, she can play soccer and swim topless, and to make things even more real she even cuts off the top
            of her bathing suit to keep only a pair of panties and even puts a piece of modeling clay in it to make it
            look like she has a penis.</p>
        <img class="imgGT" src="public/img/Tomboy_1.webp" alt="Image of Laure, from the movie Tomboy">
        <p>But one day while playing soccer, she feels a strong urge to urinate and quickly goes to relieve herself in
            the bushes, but she is caught squatting by one of the boys, so she quickly gets up and urinates on his
            shorts.</p>
        <p>The boy who surprises her tells the others how "he" (Laure) has "pissed himself". Laure feels humiliated, but
            she is not discovered, and the matter seems quickly forgotten.</p>
        <p>But the situation starts to get complicated when Lisa, who seems to fall in love, kisses her. And even more
            when, a little later, Lisa is surprised that "Mickaël" is not on the list of students for the next school
            year.</p>
        <p>However, the deception is discovered after Laure has fought with one of the boys to protect her little
            sister, and the mother of the latter comes to complain to Laure's mother, who quickly understands what has
            happened, by the fact that she talks about Laure as if it were her son, but does not contradict her.</p>
        <p>But then she forces Laure to put on a dress and takes her to the group of friends to confess her secret, who
            are shocked by this news.
            A few days later, they push Lisa to check Laure's sex by removing her pants, and Laure more than humiliated
            locks herself at home.</p>
        <p>But she decides to go out again when she sees Lisa, alone at the place where they met the first time,
            and when the latter asks her again how she is called, she reveals her birth name.</p>

        <!--Part 2 of the article-->
        <h3>What does this film provoke ?</h3>
        <p>This film re-launched the debate on the study of gender in France in 2013, and it was included in the "School
            and Cinema" scheme supported by the Ministry of National Education and the Ministry of Culture.</p>
        <p>And in a context of demonstrations against gay marriage, a petition entitled "No to the broadcasting of the
            film Tomboy in schools!" was launched, but the satisfaction rate of teachers who had seen the film was very
            high, 79% of them judging the film very interesting", and the teaching therefore judged in its report that
            it is necessary "to trust the analytical capacity of students and not to project adult fears on what
            children might think".</p>
