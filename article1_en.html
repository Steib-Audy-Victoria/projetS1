        <h2>Feminism and Simone de Beauvoir</h2>

        <!--introduction of the article-->

        <p>To be able to speak about <b>feminism</b> we must already ask ourselves the question of its definition. But
            there are several definitions of <b>feminism</b> :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>« A <b>militant</b> movement for the improvement and extension of the role and rights of women in
                society." Larousse Dictionary</li>
            <li>« <b>feminism</b> is a set of political, philosophical and social movements and ideas, which share a
                common goal: to define, establish and achieve political, economic, cultural, personal, social and legal
                equality between women and men." Wikipedia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So we can say that the definition of <b>feminism</b> s something quite personal to each person, however they
            often come together on certain points: women have and should have the same rights as men (equality man and
            woman), the gender of a person can not justify a difference in treatment, to break down <b>prejudice</b>
            against women.</p>
        <p>So everyone can be a <b>feminist</b>, even a man, because <b>feminism</b> es a set of movements and
            philosophical ideas that aim to define and <b>promote</b> equality (at different levels: political,
            economic, cultural, social and legal) between women and men by fighting for women's rights in society and in
            private life.</p>

        <!--Part 1 of the article-->
        <h3>Example of a feminist woman :</h3>
        <img class="imgGT" src="public/img/Simone_de_Beauvoir1.webp" alt="Image of Simone de Beauvoir">
        <p>Simone de Beauvoir was born on January 9, 1908 in Paris and died on April 14, 1986 in Paris. She is a
            philosopher and writer.</p>
        <p>She began to be known in 1949, by her <b>feminism</b> and <b>existentialist</b> essay "the second sex", where
            she advocates equality in the difference.</p>
        <p>Then she published the novel "The Mandarins" and won the <b>Goncourt Prize</b> in 1954.</p>
        <p>From 1958 she published autobiographical stories such as "Memoirs of a young girl row" which speaks of his
            environment full of prejudice.</p>
        <p>She also participated in the creation of the <b>existentialist</b> «magazine "Les Temps Modernes" in 1945,
            and also played an important role in the recognition of the torture inflicted on women during the Algerian
            War and for the right to abortion, in the struggles of Gisèle Halimi and Elisabeth Badinter.</p>
        <p>She is considered as a <b>pioneer</b> dof women's liberation by the
            <b>feminist</b> movements, she has demonstrated all her life that one can be a woman while being independent
            and free.
        </p>

            alt="Image of Simone de Beauvoir with the book les mandarins which made her win the Goncourt prize">
        <h3>On what subjects was she known ?</h3>
        <p>And she was especially known on three topics: </p>
        <p>The first is the mental load and domestic work, where she already explained how women were suffering a double
            day, because household chores is an additional unpaid workload, and already fought for a fairer distribution
            of tasks.
        </p>
        <p>The second is the female body, of which she explained the menstruation, the vagina or the clitoris. And in
            the second sex she talked about the physiological functioning of the female organs, which at the time
            shocked a lot and was criticized, because she talked about a subject that was still taboo at the time, the
            sexuality of women and female pleasure.</p>
        <p>And the last one is sexual freedom, where in her novel The Guest of 1943 she was inspired by her own love
            trio, with Jean-Paul Sartre, with whom she remained a free couple all her life, and Olga Kosakiewicz, one of
            her former students. She did not hide sleeping with other people, man or woman. And she did not want to
            marry or have children, she preferred to be free and live her life as she wanted.</p>
